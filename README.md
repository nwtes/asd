## Mindful Care Clinic — Single-Page Experience

Mindful Care Clinic is a responsive single-page site designed to help prospective clients quickly understand the clinic’s services, values, and ways to get in touch. The layout guides visitors from a welcoming hero, through introductory guidance, to detailed resource cards and a contact form that converts interest into action.

### Why it matters
- **Prospective clients** get calming guidance, practical next steps, and clear booking paths in one scrollable experience.
- **Clinic staff** gain an always-on marketing presence that highlights expertise, builds trust, and collects high-quality inquiries.

### Highlights
- Sticky navigation with smooth in-page anchors for fast access to each section.
- “First Treatment Tips” grid with quick wins that segue into deeper resource cards.
- Detailed cards (Anxiety, Depression, Stress, Sleep) that explain what to expect in session and link to contact points.
- Core values and contact sections that reinforce credibility and make conversion straightforward.

| View | Description | User value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Hero and navigation](assets/screenshots/home-hero.png) | Hero section with headline, CTA buttons, and sticky navigation. | Helps visitors orient instantly and choose a path (tips vs. booking). |

### Tech stack
- Semantic **HTML5** for structure, **CSS** modules (`general.css`, `header.css`, `main.css`, `contact.css`) for styling, and a tiny vanilla **JavaScript** file for smooth scrolling and mobile nav toggle.
- Typography via Google Fonts (`Manrope`, `Poppins`, `Open Sans`).
- Icons provided through Font Awesome kit `7babdebb89.js`.

### Accessibility & performance considerations
- Section IDs plus `scroll-margin-top` keep anchors visible below the sticky nav.
- Forms include labels, placeholders, and a required privacy consent checkbox.
- Imagery should be optimized (WebP/JPEG) and described with meaningful `alt` text for assistive tech.
